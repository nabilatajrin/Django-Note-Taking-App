Types of APIs
There are four main types of APIs:

-Open APIs: Also known as Public APIs, there are no restrictions to access these types of APIs because they are publicly
available.
-Partner APIs: One needs specific rights or licenses in order to access this type of APIs because they are not available
to the public.
-Internal APIs: Also known as Private APIs, only internal systems expose this type of API, which is, therefore, less
known and often meant to be used inside the company. The company uses this type of API among the different internal
teams to be able to improve its products and services.
-Composite APIs: This type of API combines different data and service APIs. It is a sequence of tasks that run
synchronously as a result of the execution and not at the request of a task. Its main uses are to speed up the process
of execution and improve the performance of the listeners in the web interfaces.
